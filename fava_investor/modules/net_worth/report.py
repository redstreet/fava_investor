"""Compute the returns of a portfolio.

A document exists to describe the problem in more detail.
http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/portfolio-returns

Calculating the returns is carried out by identifying the entries whose accounts
match a regular expression that defines accounts to consider for valuation, to
compute the returns over. This set of "related accounts" must also cover the
internal flows that occur within that account, that is, the income and expense
accounts that result in the activity of the portfolio itself.

We consider three sets of accounts:

  "VALUE ACCOUNTS" (also, "asset accounts"): Accounts whose balances are counted
    towards calculating the total value of the portfolio. These are asset
    accounts, including cash accounts.

  "INTERNAL ACCOUNTS": Accounts which are not included in the value of the
    account, but which are used to post internal activity of the account, not
    inflows or outflows. For example, the income account used to book the other
    side of a dividend receipt, which increases the value accounts, or an
    expense account used to book a commission paid or a fee, which decreases the
    value accounts. These are income and expenses accounts.

  "EXTERNAL ACCOUNTS": Accounts that are considered outside the group of value
    accounts or internal accounts. These are accounts from which funds will be
    deposited or withdrawn. These deposits or withdrawals must be excluded from
    the portfolio returns. Their presence is the reason computing portfolio
    returns isn't just a trivial exercise of comparing value at two different
    points in time.

Given this characterization, we can characterize transactions by which accounts
they have on their postings. Think of it as a Venn diagram with three circles
and all their possible intersections. We will use the following accounts in our
examples below:

  ;; Value accounts.
  2014-01-01 open Assets:Invest:Cash      USD
  2014-01-01 open Assets:Invest:BOOG      BOOG

  ;; Internal accounts.
  2014-01-01 open Income:Invest:PnL       USD
  2014-01-01 open Income:Invest:Dividends USD
  2014-01-01 open Expenses:Commissions    USD
  2014-01-01 open Expenses:Fees           USD

  ;; External accounts.
  2014-01-01 open Assets:Bank:Checking    USD
  2014-01-01 open Income:Salary           USD
  2014-01-01 open Expenses:Taxes          USD

Let us first consider transactions which have at least some value accounts:

  VALUE ONLY: All postings are on value accounts. An example would be some cash
    converted into units of a stock (with no expenses):

       2014-02-01 * "Buying some BOOG"
         Assets:Invest:Cash       -650.00 USD
         Assets:Invest:BOOG            10 BOOG {65 USD}

  VALUE + INTERNAL: Such a transaction would be one where, for example, there is
    some change that triggers a commission and/or a capital gain:

       2014-02-15 * "Selling half my position"
         Assets:Invest:BOOG            -5 BOOG {65 USD} @ 70 USD
         Assets:Invest:Cash        340.05 USD
         Expenses:Commissions        9.95 USD
         Income:Invest:PnL         -25.00 USD

     Or the receipt of a dividend:

       2014-02-20 * "Dividends from BOOG position"
         Assets:Invest:Cash         12.00 USD
         Income:Invest:Dividends   -12.00 USD

Both of these type of transactions represents transfers within asset accounts
and as such do not present any challenges or events in terms of calculating the
returns. Since internal flow accounts are meant to be considered as revenue or
costs internal to the portofolio, they can just be processed without having to
revalue the portfolio across them.


Other transactions need special treatment , however:

  VALUE + EXTERNAL: These would be tranactions either with a deposit or a
    withdrawal from/to one of the value accounts:

       2014-01-10 * "Transferring money for investing"
         Assets:Bank:Checking      -500.00 USD
         Assets:Invest:Cash         500.00 USD

       2014-06-30 * "Taking some money out for car repairs"
         Assets:Invest:Cash       -400.00 USD
         Assets:Bank:Checking      400.00 USD

For these transactions, we need to compute the value of the asset accounts
before they get applied, book the returns for the previous leg, then apply the
transaction to its accounts and revalue the value accounts, and begin a new
piecewise returns segment.


Other transactions are a bit more problematic:

  VALUE + INTERNAL + EXTERNAL: Those transactions with external flows may
    sometimes involve posting amounts to one of the internal flow accounts:

       2014-04-01 * "Transferring money by wire"
         Assets:Bank:Checking      -500.00 USD
         Assets:Invest:Cash         480.00 USD
         Expenses:Fees               20.00 USD

The question here is whether the postings with internal flows should be
internalized or not, e.g., whether the 20.00 USD wire fee in the transaction
above should be considered a cost within the portfolio activity or not. We will
assume that they always are, and in order to keep our algorithm simple, we will
internalize the postings by splitting the transaction like this:

       2014-04-01 * "Transferring money by wire" ^internalized-27356
         Assets:Bank:Checking      -500.00 USD
         Equity:Internalized        500.00 USD

       2014-04-01 * "Transferring money by wire" ^internalized-27356
         Equity:Internalized       -500.00 USD
         Assets:Invest:Cash         480.00 USD
         Expenses:Fees               20.00 USD

Here we have created a "transfer account" called "Equity:Internalized" which is
automatically added to the set of value accounts. Now we have two transactions,
one with only VALUE + EXTERNAL accounts and one with VALUE + INTERNAL accounts.
The 20$ now effectively reduces the returns of the segment that includes the
second transaction, as it is included in the internal flows.


Then, we turn to other groups that don't include value accounts:

  EXTERNAL ONLY: These are other types of transactions on completely unrelated
    accounts. We simply ignore other transactions that do not affect our value
    nor internal flow accounts. Within our limited context above, here is such a
    transaction:

       2014-01-02 * "Salary Pay"
         Income:Salary            -3461.54 USD
         Expenses:Taxes            1176.92 USD
         Assets:Bank:Checking      2284.62 USD


  INTERNAL + EXTERNAL: Then we may have transactions that affect some internal
    accounts and some external accounts. The treatment for these is less clear.
    Some internal accounts are clearly tied to our investment portfolio, such as
    "Income:Invest:Dividends" and others are more general and can be used
    outside of the context of our investment portfolio, such as "Expenses:Fees"
    which could be used to book a monthly bank fee, for example, like this:

       2014-03-17 * "Monthly fees"
         Assets:Bank:Checking        -4.00 USD
         Expenses:Fees                4.00 USD

    Such a transaction should clearly not be considered as part of our portfolio
    in any way. The only relation is the common use of the "Expenses:Fees"
    account between transactions in the portfolio and transactions outside the
    portfolio. However, consider this transaction where an income account that
    is clearly associated with our portfolio is used to receive a dividend in an
    external account:

       2014-03-20 * "Dividend payment correction with fee"
         Income:Invest:Dividends     -9.00 USD
         Assets:Bank:Checking         9.00 USD

     This should clearly be included in the portfolio. The problem here is that
     there is no distinction between an internal flow account tied to this
     portfolio, such as "Income:Invest:Dividends" and one that is not and which
     is used widely outside of this context, such as "Expenses:Fees".

     In the context of this example, such transactions never occur. But...
     consider what would happen if we were attempting to compute the value of
     the portfolio excepting cash: the "Assets:Invest:Cash" account and a
     regular dividend contribution becomes one of these transactions:

       2014-03-20 * "Dividend payment"
         Income:Invest:Dividends     -9.00 USD ;; Internal
         Assets:Invest:Cash           9.00 USD ;; External

     So we will have to do something about those transactions: we provide the
     user with the ability to specify a list of accounts that will force
     internalization ("accounts_internalize"). When specified, transactions with
     no value accounts but with some postings matching one of these accounts
     will be internalized explicitly.


  INTERNAL ONLY: Finally, consider this contrived example transaction where a
    dividend happens to equal exactly some fee:

       2014-03-20 * "Dividend payment with fee"
         Income:Invest:Dividends     -9.00 USD
         Expenses:Fees                9.00 USD

     It is unclear whether that should be in the portfolio or not. We have no
     way to know. In either case, the transaction would have no impact on the
     value of the portfolio, so we choose to ignore these transactions safely.
     (Examples of these are rare.)


Notes:

 - If you use the "account_rounding" option, the rounding postings will
   naturally end up being external flows and that's an undesirable effect. If
   the option is turned on, we automatically ignore those postigs. (Note that
   another valid solution would have been to insert this account in the list of
   internal accounts but that creates a more difficult set of resulting
   transactions, it's a bit confusing.).
