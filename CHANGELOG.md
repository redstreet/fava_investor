- assetalloc_class fail due to favapricemap vs beancount pricemap (#92)

## 0.7.0 (2024-02-02)

This release brings fava_investor up to date with upstream changes in Fava. Primarily,
asset allocation by class was fixed. Thanks to contributors below.

### Fixes

- Fix assetalloc_class chart (#93) [Adriano Di Luzio]
- remove dead code for Fava <v1.18 (#91) [Jakob Schnitzer]
- hierarchy chart: remove now uneeded modifier (#90) [Jakob Schnitzer]
- libsummarizer crash in Fava (wrong pricemap) [Red S]
- build_beancount_pricemap() was missing in cli version. [Red S]


## 0.6.0 (2024-02-02)

### Improvements

- Fix to work with upstream changes (Fava 1.25+)

- Make currency regex not incorrectly match substrings (#88) [Tyler Schicke]

  This changes the currency regexes use '^<currency>$' instead of just
  matching '<currency>', so that specifying a currency only matches that
  currency exactly, instead of also matching currencies that contain the
  specified currency.
- Preserve costs during tax adjustment (#83) [korrat]

  * Preserve costs during tax adjustment

  Previously, tax adjustment discarded the cost of positions, causing
  beancount.core.convert.convert_position to miss some conversion paths
  via the cost currency. This necessitated a fallback to operating
  currencies for finding viable transitive conversions.

  With this patch, tax adjustment preserves the cost of positions.
  Therefore, the cost currency is still available for automatic detection
  of transitive conversions when computing the asset allocation.

  One important assumption is that tax adjustment only ever encounters
  costs after realization, as having a cost spec for the total cost would
  change the cost per unit. This assumption is checked via assert and has
  been manually tested without error on the multicurrency example.

  The patch leaves the fallback logic for conversion via operating
  currencies in place as an alternative when conversion via cost currency
  fails.
  * Fix lint warnings

  this simplifies config, and clarifies.
